You can come in for a consultation where we can better understand how many bonds are needed and choose the right hair, suitable for your structureü•∞
In-person consultation is strongly recommended for we take a personalized approach to hair extensions. Unlike other salons, we carefully select the hair structure and category, then manually encapsulate and prepare the hair specifically for each customer. Because of this customized process, a consultation‚Äîeither online or in-person‚Äîis essential.
Please note that consultation online is possible if you can't do it in person for some reasons. In fact, due to online consultation we can give you an approximate quote, because the camera really distorts the color and shade of your hair. So when you come to your hair extensions appointment after online consultation the quote could be higher for we need more bonds and different colors.‚Äù **–í–∞–∂–Ω–æ:** –æ—Ç–ø—Ä–∞–≤–ª—è–π —ç—Ç–æ —Å–æ–æ–±—â–µ–Ω–∏–µ, —Ç–æ–ª—å–∫–æ –µ—Å–ª–∏ –∫–ª–∏–µ–Ω—Ç –Ω–µ –ø–∏—à–µ—Ç –æ —Ç–æ–º, —á—Ç–æ —É –Ω–µ–≥–æ –∞–ª–æ–ø–µ—Ü–∏—è, –æ–±–ª—ã—Å–µ–Ω–∏–µ, –ø–æ—Ç–µ—Ä—è –≤–æ–ª–æ—Å, –≤—ã–ø–∞–¥–µ–Ω–∏–µ –≤–æ–ª–æ—Å –ø–æ—Å–ª–µ —Ö–∏–º–∏–æ—Ç–µ—Ä–∞–ø–∏–∏.
